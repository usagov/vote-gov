  <p>Vote.gov is creating a simple tool to help eligible citizens fill out the National Voter Registration Form (NVRF). By answering a few online questions, the user generates a completed form that can be printed and mailed.</p>

  <p>This form will allow users to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Register to vote</li>
    <li>Update registration information</li>
    <li>Register with a political party</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The new form filler tool aims to streamline over 20 pages of instructions that have been hard to follow. Registrants select the state they plan to vote in. Then, the form presents only the instructions and fields the user needs, based on the choices users make.</p>

  <h2>The web-based form improves accessibility and usability.</h2>
