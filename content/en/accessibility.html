<p>At vote.gov, we’re committed to accessibility. It is our policy to ensure that everyone, including people with disabilities, has full and equal access to voting resources.
The vote.gov website relies on certain technologies to make sure it works well with tools that help people with disabilities access information on websites. These technologies include HTML, WAI-ARIA, CSS and JavaScript. They make sure the site is easy to use with screen readers, screen magnifiers, speech-recognition software and other assistive technologies.</p>

<h2 id="statement">Accessibility statement</h2>
<p>The vote.gov team is committed to creating an accessible website for all voters, including people who have difficulty seeing, hearing, operating computer hardware, or who experience cognitive or learning challenges. We also seek to reach underserved people, including those whose primary language is not English. Accessibility is an ongoing effort, and we seek to improve our site by providing regular training for the employees who write our content, create our documents, and build our website.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-support-and-maintain">How we support and maintain accessibility</h2>
<p><strong>We ensure the accessibility of vote.gov by:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Manually testing content for keyboard and screen reader accessibility</li>
  <li>Using semantic section headings to organize the content</li>
  <li>Allowing people to use the keyboard to access all links and interactive parts of our website</li>
  <li>Including “skip to main content” functionality</li>
  <li>Adding code to external links to announce “opening in new window” for screen readers</li>
  <li>Providing detailed alt text for images, icons, and logos</li>
  <li>Engaging real people in the translation of content to deliver context and user experience</li>
  <li>Allowing users to resize text according to preference</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-standards">Our accessibility standards</h2>
<p>We design our web pages to meet or exceed the <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> standards, which are the technical requirements that ensure we’re complying with federal Section 508 law.

We meet Level AA standards, which means our content is accessible to most people in most circumstances.</p>
