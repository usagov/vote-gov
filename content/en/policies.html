  <h3>Social Media Sites</h3>
  <p>Vote.gov manages a presence on social media sites such as Twitter to share government information, and engage with
    the public. We do not collect any personally identifiable information through those sites, and we do not use
    personal information made available by the third-party sites.</p>
  <h2 id="cookies">If You Send Us Personal Information</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to your request. The only personal
    information that we collect is what you decide to give us by subscribing to our email subscription services.</p>
  <p>We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency,
    or as otherwise required by law. Vote.gov never collects information or creates individual profiles for commercial
    marketing.</p>
