There is no national voter registration deadline. Voters in each state and territory must follow their voter registration laws. Select your state or territory from the dropdown menu to find your voter registration deadline.

Every state except North Dakota requires citizens to register if they want to vote. Some states require voters to register up to 30 days before an election, while others allow registration up to and on Election Day. Itâ€™s important you know the rules in your state.
