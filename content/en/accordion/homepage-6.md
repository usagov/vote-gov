When you register to vote, you'll be sent a voter registration card. This card confirms that you are registered and ready to vote. Your voter registration card typically includes your name, your home address, and the address of the polling station where you’ll vote. You can also look up your voter registration using your state’s voter registration lookup tool online.

If your name or address changes, you will need to update your voter registration. Once you’ve updated your voter registration information, you may receive a new voter registration card, depending on your state. If you have questions, your local election office is the best resource to help.

You do not usually need to have your voter registration card with you in order to vote, but you may need to present another [form of ID to vote](https://www.usa.gov/voter-id). Learn more about [voter registration](https://www.usa.gov/voter-registration-card).
