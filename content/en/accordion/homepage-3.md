Select your state or territory from the dropdown menu to check your registration before your state’s deadline. That could be up to 30 days before the election.

Also check to see if your registration is marked “inactive.” You may become “inactive” if you did not vote in at least two federal elections and did not respond when election officials tried to reach you.

An inactive status does not necessarily mean that you need to re-register.  It means that you may have to take extra steps before you can vote. Your state election official’s office or your local election office can help you move your registration status back to active or answer questions you may have.

Make sure you are registered with the correct name, address, and political party affiliation. Visit your state’s registration page for information on how to update your voter registration information.
