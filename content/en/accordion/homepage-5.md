title = "Change your political party affiliation"
+++
Each state has a different process to select or change your party affiliation. Depending on your state, you may be asked for your party affiliation when you register to vote. Your state may not have political party affiliations for voters. Contact your state or local election office to see what the procedure is and if there are any deadlines for where you live. Selecting a party affiliation is not available in all states.

Regardless of which party you choose, the voting process is the same in a general election, which is when candidates are elected to offices. Your party affiliation impacts who you can vote for in [primary elections and caucuses](https://www.usa.gov/election#item-37162).
