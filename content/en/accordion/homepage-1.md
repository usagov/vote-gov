All states except North Dakota require that you register before voting in an election. Select your state or territory from the dropdown menu to find the rules that apply to you.

U.S. citizens living outside the U.S., including U.S. service members and their families, can register to vote and request an absentee ballot by completing the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). U.S. military family members, like everyone else, must meet U.S. voter eligibility requirements to register and request a ballot. For more information, visit the [Federal Voter Assistance Program](https://www.fvap.gov/).
