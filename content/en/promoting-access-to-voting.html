  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Voting is a right and civic responsibility that provides American citizens over the age of 18 with the opportunity
    to shape their government. Over the course of American history, voting rights have evolved to become more inclusive
    and accessible. Today, citizens over the age of 18 cannot be denied the right to vote on the basis of race,
    religion, sex, disability, or sexual orientation. Vote.gov strives to promote and increase voting participation
    nationwide by providing vital information that enables registration and voting. To offer the most value to the
    American public, Vote.gov is working to modernize and broaden the information offered to users.</p>
  <h2>Overview of Federal Requirements</h2>
  <p>In March 2021, President Joe Biden released the <strong>Executive Order, Promoting Access to Voting</strong> which tasked GSA and
    the Vote.gov website team to modernize and upgrade the website’s user experience in order to promote access to
    voting, with an emphasis on underrepresented communities. Below is an overview of the Executive Order requirements
    relevant to Vote.gov and the respective actions the team is taking to meet each requirement.</p>

  <h2>Vote.gov’s Vision</h2>
  <p>The Vote.gov team is committed to empowering the American public with accurate, up to date, and actionable voting

    partnerships both with government and industry stakeholders. The following statements describe the desired future
    state and experience that voters and partners will have with Vote.gov.</p>
