  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Established in 2016, Vote.gov provides trustworthy voting information to the American public. The Vote.gov team is committed to empowering the public with accurate, up-to-date, and actionable voting information. In addition to partnering with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), Vote.gov collaborates openly with nonpartisan, third-party organizations, as well as election offices.</p>

  <h2>What We’re Doing</h2>
  <p>Vote.gov aims to create impactful changes that will modernize and improve the user experience of the website. The teamʼs priorities include: </p>
  <ul class="usa-list">
    <li>Continuing to <strong>expand language selection.</strong></li>
    <li>Providing a <strong>single national source of voting information</strong> to help combat
misinformation while <strong>directing voters to their state and local election offices</strong> for
more state-specific questions.</li>
    <li>Building <strong>strategic partnerships</strong> to foster trust in voter information and further
dismantle misinformation.</li>
    <li>Improving <strong>usability and accessibility</strong> to state and local-hosted voter registration opportunities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where We’re Going</h2>
  <p>Vote.gov envisions an enhanced website that will provide active links to state and local election websites for details on voting and voter registration. We also plan to provide more complete content that will further solidify Vote.gov as a nationally acceptable authoritative source of general voting information and further facilitate a reliable registration process for voters nationwide.</p>
  <p>As Vote.gov begins this modernization effort, the team will leverage key partnerships both with government and industry stakeholders, including non-profit organizations. The following statements describe the desired future state and experience that voters and partners will have with Vote.gov.</p>



  <h2>Overview of Federal Requirements</h2>
  <p>In March 2021, President Joe Biden released the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/">Executive Order, Promoting Access to Voting</a> which tasked GSA and Vote.gov with modernizing and upgrading the websiteʼs user experience in order to promote access to voting, with an emphasis on underserved communities. Below is an overview of the Executive Orderʼs requirements relevant to Vote.gov and the respective actions the team is taking to meet each requirement.</p>
