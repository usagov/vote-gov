<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Vote.gov is your authoritative, trusted source for voting information. Because voter registration happens at the state level, Vote.gov directs Americans to registration rules for their own states.</p>
<p>In addition to partnering with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), Vote.gov collaborates openly with nonpartisan, third party organizations as well as with state and local election officials.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>A team of USA.gov staff and <a href="https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> developed Vote.gov as a trustworthy online voter registration tool. Established in 2016, Vote.gov empowers the public with accurate, up-to-date, and actionable voting information.</p>

<p>Today, the Vote.gov team continues to improve the site to meet the goals outlined in President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/">2021 Executive Order, Promoting Access to Voting</a>. These goals include improving accessibility, translating voter tools into key languages, and enhancing search functionality on the website.</p>
